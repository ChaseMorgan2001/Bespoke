# Bespoke
In Oxford, England there is a restaurant near the train station called Sojo and
they serve wonderful Chinese food: Dim sum, noodles, Cantonese, Szechuan. If you ask for
a “bespoke” set, they will put together something delicious for you from their extensive
menu. It’s a surprise, and always good. 

This program is a GUI based off of the Sojo Restaurant. The user can pick menu item, and/or have the program select items for them at random.
